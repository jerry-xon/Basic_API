# Basic_API
This repository contains a basic example of a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js. It demonstrates how to set up a simple server, define routes, and handle HTTP requests for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data.

### Features:

- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building APIs and web applications.
- **Routing**: Examples of handling GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- **Middleware**: Usage of middleware for request processing and error handling.
- **JSON Responses**: Sending and receiving JSON data to and from the client.
- **Modular Code**: Well-structured code with routes and controllers separated for easy scalability.
